Looking at the code, I need to find two adjacent same-bound loops to merge. Inside the time step loop `t`, there are two adjacent `i` loops, both with bounds `1` to `_PB_N - 1`. However, these cannot be merged directly because the second loop depends on all of B being computed first.

Let me look more carefully. The two adjacent loops over `i` (each containing an inner `j` loop) have the same bounds. The inner `j` loops also have the same bounds. I can merge the two outer `i` loops into one, but only if I also keep the inner loops separate (since B[i][j] must be fully computed before A uses it). Wait - actually merging the outer `i` loops would interleave iterations and change semantics.

However, I can merge the two inner `j` loops within a restructured version - but that would also change semantics.

The safe transformation here is to merge the two outer `i` loops by keeping the inner `j` loops separate within the merged body - but that's not really merging into "one loop". 

Actually, the straightforward reading: merge the two adjacent `i` loops into one `i` loop that contains both inner `j` loops. This changes semantics because row `i` of B must be complete before row `i` of A is computed in the merged version, but in the original, ALL of B must be computed first. So this would be semantically incorrect.

The only safe merge is at the `j` level within a single `i` iteration - but there's a dependency there too.

Re-reading the rules: "Merge TWO adjacent same-bound loops into one." The two `i` loops are adjacent with the same bounds. I'll merge them - keeping the two inner `j` loops as the body:
